# Maya-UI-Changer

This is a suite of tools created in order to allow greater customization of Maya’s user environment. This project is currently a work in progress so some aspects may not function as intended.

Adds a new “Themes” menu item to Maya’s menu bar. Navigate to it to cycle through the available theme presets. <br>

Installation:
-
1) Go to <a href="https://github.com/Aldanoah/MayaUIChanger/releases">releases</a> to download the latest "MayaUIChanger.zip" version.
2) Place the "MayaUIChanger" folder in your Maya scripts directory e.g "..\Documents\maya\2024\scripts\MayaUIChanger".
3) Copy the "userSetup.py" file in the folder to your Maya scripts directory e.g "..\Documents\maya\2024\scripts.
5) Launch Maya.
6) if the "Themes" menu item is missing, you may alternatively run the "UIPresetLoader.py" script through Maya's script editor.

Note:
-
You may need to set your maya script directory as a new system variable. You can do so by searching for "environment variables" on windows then performing the following steps.

- Navigate to the fonts folder in the script directory to install the optional “dejavu-sans” and “Rajdhani” font packs. These fonts enhance the look of the theme presets but are not required for their functioning.

A Script to customize Maya's Splash screen is also bundled with this project. It requires launching Maya as an adminstrator in order to function correctly. The script currently only takes .wav and .png files and doesn't support resizing images so a target image size of 860x500px is recommended. Simply run the SplashLoader.py script to use. <br><br> Please unmute the video preview. 


Compatibility:
-
Maya 2024 - 2026 but likely to work on earlier versions.
